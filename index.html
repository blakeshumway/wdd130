        <p>Hi there! My name is Blake Shumway from Oklahoma, and this is my web page! I like to play video games, work on video games, learn about coding, read, talk with friends and experience new foods!
            I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the California Anaheim mission from 2021 - 2023. One thing that I love to study about is American History as well as Church History. I love to learn about our forefathers and the sacrifices they made for us to live in this country today, as well as there strong conviction and testimony in following Jesus Christ.
            I also like to read the Book of Mormon and try to better understand the situations the people in it were going through and how I can apply the lessons they learned in my live as well.
            First and foremost my priority in life is to follow and server my Savior Jesus Christ, following His example in all things.
        </p>
