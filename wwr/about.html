            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>We here at Whitewater rafting have been in business for over 40 years! Our founder Keith Jacobson wanted to share his love of whitewater rafting with as many people as possible, so what better way to do that than make a company dedicated to his passion! Since then we have been able to expand our company to a national audience and seek to continue to grow and share our love of rafting with others!</p>
            
            <img src="images/whitewater-3.jpg" alt="happy rafters">
            <p>Rafters who have joined us on our adventures have said that they've never had such an amazing experience rafting before rafting with us! We look forward to our future of continued adventures as we expand our company and create new rafting sites. We strive to continue the vision out founder Keith Jacobson had of a bright, and more adventurous future whitewater rafting!
